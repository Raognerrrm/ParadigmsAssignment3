Bash script notes
=================

The script can be run as follows:
    
    /optimize.sh input output optnumber

Where if optnumber is 1: Run no optimasations
                      2: Run the unreachable code optimisation
                      3: Run the deadcode optimisation
                      4: Run the redundant loads optimisation
                      5: Run the unreachable code optimisation, then the deadcode optimisation
                      6: Run the unreachable code optimisation, then the redundant loads optimisation
                      7: Run the redundant loads optimisation, then the deadcode optimisation
                      8: Run the unreachable code optimisation, then the redundant loads optimisation, then the deadcode optimisation

If the bash scripts do not work, try running dos2unix on them, e.g.

    dos2unix optimize.sh
    
then try running the scripts again.


File summaries
==============
All important functions can be found at the bottom of each file (except happy-generated files)
The following files can be found in /Optimisanaitanu
- IParser.y: Used to generate IParser.hs using happy. Contains a parseFile function that takes in a filepath
- Unreachable.hs: Used to remove unreachable blocks in a function. It does not remove unreachable functions.
                  It assumes that if a block is branched to, it is reachable
- DeadCode.hs: Used to remove instructions that do not affect the return value
- Redundant.hs: Used to rewrite registers so that less loads can be used.
                This one does not work properly. Single blocks work fine, but when more are added it sometimes changes the correct registers to the correct things, sometimes changes the right register to the wrong thing (it's still a valid register, but doesn't help cutting down on the number of loads), and sometimes does nothing.
- FlowGraph.hs: Used to store helper functions used across all 3 optimisations and generate a block flow graph


Unit testing
============
Some tests were  written, but not exhaustive ones.


Dead code notes
============

Assume the block flow graph is acyclic - this allows us to do a topological sort to decide
the order to visit blocks in when performing a backwards flow analysis.

Once we have the order, start with an empty used reg list. Stores, branches, etc. add to the list.
Loads check if the reg is in the list - if it is then remove it and keep the load. Otherwise,
the load is useless and is hence removed.

When going to a new block, the remaining used registers from other blocks are unioned.
